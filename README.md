🚧 under heavy development 🚧

TL;DR of the purpose is: beautiful, performant, great DX, pick three.

A full-fledged desktop application framework that deals with window management,
event handling, rendering, and state management, providing lots of React-like
DX in a more immediate-mode fashion.

# The Grand Plan

For some time I've felt like we need a change in that scenery.

Electron was great, it let web developers reach feats that would take so much
more to accomplish without it, and I'm forever going to be thankful for it.
However, it came with a cost: performance.

# Road Map

1. Building out 10 complete examples of real-world UI that inspire me (right now)
2. Build out real, mostly open-source, applications to showcase it with
3. Support as many languages as possible

The full road ahead can't quite be defined yet, but those are some of the main
milestones I want to reach. This is a multiyear project, so I do not want to
get tied to the priorities of when this was written.

See the current [to-dos](./TODO.md) for more details. Also, you can read the project's
(open questions)[./notes/open-questions.md] that I've had while building.

# No LICENSE?

I am not completely sure what path I want to take with the project
licensing-wise. Building this has taken me considerate time, learning, and
effort, so the likeliest way I will take is to have it priced somehow. Most
likely, free for individuals, but paid for companies.
