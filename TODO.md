- [x] fix where image should be transparent being white
    - Decided to not do it, it's caused by uhoh.com using blendMode: multiply which we don't do at all
- [x] fix image anti aliasing to look more like the browser
- [x] what do I need to have variant fonts?
- [x] text wrapping
- [ ] text selection
    - full of unknowns, I'm not absolutely sure how I'm tackling this
    - we need selection to span from one layout box to the other, with a start and an end over the characters
    - once selected, we should also allow users to copy with ctrl + c 
    - one other problem
